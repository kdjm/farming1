            <p> Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary
                human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. 
                history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent
                farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants
                were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture
                in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence
                agriculture.The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials 
                (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, eggs and fungi.
                Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although 
                in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues, especially in
                developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that 
                brings an enormous crop yield increase.Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides 
                and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but causing ecological
                and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the
                output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include
                contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and growth hormones in
                industrial meat production. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as 
                biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation and global warming, all of which can cause decreases in crop
                yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.

                <h2>Tillage/Spraying</h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6bWK95hvvU"></iframe>
                <p id="p">The effect of tillage on weed emergence depends on factors that include intensity and timing of tillage, type and
                    depth of the tillage equipment, and the extent that the soil environment is modified by the tillage
                    (Chauhan et al., 2006d). As discussed in a previous section, tillage determines the vertical seed
                    distribution in the soil profile and this in turn affects seedling establishment through the likely
                    influence of factors such as seed predation, seed dormancy, seed longevity, and potential of a seedling
                    to emerge from a given depth (e.g., Chauhan et al., 2006d).Tillage may stimulate germination of some weed seeds 
                    by exposing buried seeds to light, aerating soil, increasing soil temperature, removing plant canopy, releasing
                    soil-bound volatile inhibitors, and increasing seed–soil moisture contact (Chauhan et al., 2006c,d; Franke et al.,
                    2007; Ghersa and Martínez-Ghersa, 2000; Sauer and Struik, 1964; Scopel et al., 1994). Enhanced germination of P.
                    minor during plowing in India, for example, was attributed to light stimuli (Franke et al., 2007). Tillage also
                    increases diffusion of O2 into and CO2 out of the soil, increases the amplitude of temperature fluctuations,
                    and favors nitrogen mineralization (Mohler, 1993). Such factors are known to ease dormancy and stimulate
                    germination (e.g., Benech-Arnold et al., 2000). Generally, if tillage brings deeply buried seeds to the surface,
                    seedling emergence is likely to increase, while it will decrease if tillage buries surface seeds deeper
                    in the soil (e.g., Chauhan et al., 2006d).

                <h2>Sowing</h2>
                <img src="C:\Users\SAL\Desktop\Website    Visual Studio Code\Practice Home\FARMING\download (1).jpg">

                <p> Hand sowing or (planting) is the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground, or broadcasting
                    (from which the technological term is derived[citation needed]). Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to
                    incorporate the seed into the soil. Though labor-intensive for any but small areas, this method is still
                    used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can
                    be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.A tray
                    used in horticulture (for sowing and taking plant cuttings)Hand sowing may be combined with pre-sowing in seed 
                    trays. This allows the plants to come to strength indoors during cold periods (e.g. spring in temperate countries)\
                    Seed drill In agriculture, most seed is now sown using a seed drill, which offers greater precision
                    below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system,
                    which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10–30 cm apart,
                    depending on the crop species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on soil
                    type and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by tractors, but can also be pulled by horses.
                    Pickup trucks are sometimes used, since little draft is required.A seed rate of about 100 kg of seed per
                    hectare (2 bushels per acre) is typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil 
                    conditions, and farmer's preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to lodge, while too thin a rate
                    will result in poor utilisation of the land, competition with weeds and a reduction in the yield.Open field 
                    Main article: Open field system Open-field planting refers to the form of sowing used historically
                    in the agricultural context whereby fields are prepared generically and left open, as the name suggests,
                    before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently left uncovered at the surface of the soil before
                    germinating and therefore exposed to the prevailing climate and conditions like storms etc. This is in 
                    contrast to the seedbed method used more commonly in domestic gardening or more specific (modern)
                    agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the soil surface and monitored and manually
                    tended frequently to ensure more successful growth rates and better yields.

                <p> Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse
                    for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper .[1] On smaller farms with minimal mechanization,
                    harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season. On large mechanized farms, harvesting 
                    uses the most expensive and sophisticated farm machinery, such as the combine harvester. Process automation
                    has increased the efficiency of both the seeding and harvesting processes. Specialized harvesting equipment
                    utilizing conveyor belts to mimic gentle gripping and mass-transport replaces the manual task of removing
                    each seedling by hand.[2] The term "harvesting" in general usage may include immediate postharvest handling,
                    including cleaning, sorting, packing, and cooling.The completion of harvesting marks the end of the growing
                    season, or the growing cycle for a particular crop, and the social importance of this event makes it the focus 
                    of seasonal celebrations such as harvest festivals, found in many religions.

                <p> The SCM process starts with figuring out what products customers want. This phase involves the early stages of supply
                    chain planning, traditionally considered one of the two overarching categories of SCM along with supply chain execution.
                    Supply chain planning starts with demand planning, a process for gathering historical data, such as past sales, and 
                    applying analytics and statistical modeling to create a forecast or demand plan that the sales department and 
                    operational departments -- for example, manufacturing and marketing -- can agree on. The forecast determines the
                    types and quantities of products to be manufactured. Getting the forecast right is critical for avoiding costly
                    problems such as the bullwhip effect, in which small fluctuations in retail demand are magnified further up the
                    supply chain, leading to severe shortages or surpluses of inventory. Some companies perform demand planning as part 
                    of a formalized process called sales and operations planning (S&OP), which encompasses an iterative process of data 
                    gathering, discussion, reconciling of demand plans with production plans, and management approval. Some companies 
                    include S&OP in a broader process called integrated business planning (IBP) that incorporates other departments'
                    plans in a single companywide plan.

            <p> Irrigation is the agricultural process of applying controlled amounts of water to land to assist in the production 
                of crops,[1] as well as to grow landscape plants and lawns, where it may be known as watering. Agriculture that
                does not use irrigation but instead relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed. Irrigation has
                been a central feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and has been developed independently by many cultures 
                across the globe. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed
                soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop 
                production, including frost protection,[2] suppressing weed growth in grain fields[3] and preventing soil
                consolidation.[4] Irrigation systems are also used for cooling livestock, dust suppression, disposal of sewage,
                and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the removal of surface and
                sub-surface water from a given location.There are various types of irrigation. Micro-irrigation uses less
                pressure and water flow than overhead irrigation. Drip irrigation trickles out at the root zone.

            <p> A working animal is an animal, usually domesticated, that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks instead
                of being slaughtered to harvest animal products. Some are beasts of burden that provide transportation and aid
                in physical labor, while others are service animals trained to execute certain specialized tasks (such as guide dogs).
                They may also be used for milking or herding. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or
                other products such as leather.The history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our
                hunter-gatherer ancestors. Around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. 
                Domesticated species are often bred for different uses and conditions, especially horses and working dogs.
                Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins
                and some Asian elephants.
